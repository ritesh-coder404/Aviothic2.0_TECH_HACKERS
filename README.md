# AVIITHIC2.0-TECH_HACKERS
A creative and modern *mood-based music player* built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.  
This web app automatically changes the background color and plays YouTube music based on your selected mood —  
*Happy 😊, **Sad 😔, or **Chill 😎*.  

It’s simple, responsive, and gives a real “mood-changing” experience every time you click a button.

## ✨ Features  
- 🎵 *Auto Music Change* — Plays YouTube videos based on your mood  
- 🌈 *Dynamic Background Colors* — Background adjusts to your vibe  
- ⚡ *Smooth Animations* — Buttons glow and bounce on hover & click  
- 📱 *Fully Responsive* — Works on mobile & desktop both  
- 💫 *Chill Mode Added* — With relaxing Lo-Fi beats  
- 🧠 *Built with Pure Code* — No frameworks or libraries

## 🧩 How It Works  
1. The page loads with a *Happy song* by default.  
2. When you click any mood button (Happy, Sad, Chill), JavaScript changes the iframe’s YouTube src.  
3. The background color also changes smoothly to match that mood.  
4. All songs autoplay (muted) and loop infinitely.
