# Play Your Mood
A creative and modern *mood-based music player* built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.  
This web app automatically changes the background color and plays YouTube music based on your selected mood —  
*Happy 😊, **Sad 😔, or **Chill 😎*.  

It’s simple, responsive, and gives a real “mood-changing” experience every time you click a button.

## 🧩 How It Works  
1. The page loads with a *Happy song* by default.  
2. When you click any mood button (Happy, Sad, Chill,Patriotic,Sleepy), JavaScript changes the iframe’s YouTube src.  
3. The background color also changes smoothly to match that mood.  
4. All songs autoplay (muted) and loop infinitely.
